Original Plan:

Dog Personality Quiz

Front end has multiple question prompts with radio button option answers, and a submit at the end that send the results to backend. This project will use SQL tables as a database to hold responses. The radio buttons are true or false. The booleans will then be evaluated for each column to total your score, +1 for true or 0 for false. The total score will be added, and the sum will lead to an if-elseif chain, showing if the sum is = a number, the name of that corresponding dog will take you to facts about that dog.

MVP:
    Front-end Radio buttons send values to back end
    Data held on database
    Data retrieved, evaluated, and returned to the front end to display results

Stretch goals: Have it move to a separate page for results that populates with dog info and pictures.
